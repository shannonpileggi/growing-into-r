# Growing into the R community


A talk for R-Ladies Miami on April 22, 2021 based on the blog post [A job interview presentation inspired by the R community:
How `#tidytuesday` and twitter helped me secure a job offer](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2020-08-30-a-job-interview-presentation-inspired-by-the-r-community/).


## Abstract

_DRAFT_

Starting something new in R can be daunting, but there are many community resources that can help! In this presentation, I’ll discuss how I crafted a project for a job interview presentation by making modifications on publicly available TidyTuesday code. This created the scaffolding that gave me the technical knowledge and confidence necessary for more open-ended projects. This inspired me to give back to the R community, so I’ll also discuss how I slowly transitioned from a consumer to a creator and even a collaborator which has been incredibly fulfilling. In a time when we are all socially distanced, I feel more connected to the R community than ever before.
