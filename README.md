### Abstract

Starting something new in R can be daunting, but there are many community resources that can help! In this presentation, I‚Äôll discuss how I crafted a job interview presentation by making modifications on publicly available TidyTuesday code. This built the technical and confidence-boosting scaffolding I needed for more open-ended projects. The success of this experience inspired me to transition from my role as a consumer and creator to contributor to give back to the R community, which has been incredibly fulfilling. Despite social distancing, I feel more connected to the R community than ever before!
